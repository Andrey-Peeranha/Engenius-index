# Step-by-Step Guide to Integrate Allure with XCUITest

## 1. Add JUnit Reporting to Your XCUITest Project
XCTest supports generating test results in JUnit XML format, which Allure can process.

1. Modify Your Test Execution Command:
Use the xcodebuild tool with the -resultBundlePath or â€“resultBundle option to generate test results.

xcodebuild test \
-scheme YourAppScheme \
-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14,OS=16.0' \
-resultBundlePath TestResults

2. Export JUnit Reports:
Use the xcresulttool to extract JUnit-compatible reports:

xcrun xcresulttool get --format junit --path TestResults.xcresult > TestResults.xml

## 2. Install Allure Command-Line Tool
Install the Allure CLI tool, which will process the JUnit XML files and generate Allure reports.

Install Allure:
If you have Homebrew, install Allure:
brew install allure

Verify Installation:
Check if Allure is installed successfully:
allure --version

## 3. Configure Allure to Use JUnit Reports
Set Up Allure Report Directory:
Create a directory to store the generated Allure reports:

mkdir allure-results

Move JUnit Report to Allure Results Directory:
Copy the generated TestResults.xml into the allure-results directory:

cp TestResults.xml allure-results/

## 4. Generate Allure Reports
Run Allure Command:
Generate Allure reports from the JUnit results:

allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report

Serve the Report Locally:
Launch the Allure report in your browser:

allure serve allure-results

## 5. Integrate with CI/CD (Optional)
If youâ€™re using a CI/CD pipeline, you can automate this process:

Collect Test Results:
Use xcodebuild to run tests and export results during the pipeline.
Generate Allure Reports:
Add a script to process the JUnit XML files and publish the Allure reports as part of the pipeline.
Publish the Reports:
Use CI/CD plugins or custom scripts to host the generated Allure reports.

# Additional Tips
Custom Labels and Steps: If you want to add custom labels or steps to the Allure report, youâ€™ll need to process the test results or modify your test cases to include additional metadata.
Use xcparse for Easier Parsing: Tools like xcparse can make working with Xcode test results easier:

brew install chargepoint/xcparse/xcparse
xcparse test-plans TestResults.xcresult allure-results

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Allure Reports into your XCUITest workflow to achieve detailed and visually appealing test reports.
