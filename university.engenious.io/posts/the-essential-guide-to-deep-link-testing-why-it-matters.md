## How to launch deep link testing: Step-by-step manual

Deep linking involves creating a URL that links directly to a specific location within a mobile app rather than simply launching the app. This is particularly useful for testing specific features or workflows within the app. 

Here’s a step-by-step manual for a newbie in software testing to launch deep link testing:

### Step 1: Understand the App’s URL Scheme
Before you can test deep links, you need to understand the URL scheme that your app uses. This is usually provided by the development team.
The URL scheme is a custom URL that triggers the app to open at a specific page or state.
### Step 2: Set Up Your Testing Environment
Ensure you have access to the mobile device or emulator where the app is installed.
Install any necessary tools for intercepting and sending URLs to the device, such as ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for Android devices, or XCode’s Recovery Mode or DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode.
### Step 3: Create Deep Link URLs
Based on the URL scheme, create the URLs that will direct the app to the specific content or feature you want to test.
For example, if you’re testing a shopping app, you might have a URL like `myapp://product/123` to open the app directly on the product page for item 123.
### Step 4: Send the Deep Link to the Device
Use ADB or a similar tool to send the deep link to the device. For example, with ADB you can use the command:
`adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "myapp://product/123"`

This command will open the app and navigate directly to the deep link’s destination.
### Step 5: Verify the App’s Response
Once the deep link is launched, verify that the app opens to the correct location and that the content or feature is displayed as expected.
Check for any errors or unexpected behavior.
### Step 6: Automate the Process
To automate deep link testing, you can use a test automation framework like Appium or Espresso, or XCUITest for iOS.
Write test scripts that send deep links to the app and assert the correct app behavior.
### Step 7: Expand Test Coverage
Create additional deep links to cover different parts of the app.
Test various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.
### Step 8: Integrate with Continuous Integration (CI)
Integrate your automated deep link tests with your CI pipeline to run them regularly.
This ensures that deep link functionality is checked with every new build of the app.
### Step 9: Document Your Findings
Keep a record of the deep links tested, the results, and any issues found.
Share this documentation with the development team for bug fixing and improvements.
### Step 10: Continuous Learning
Stay updated with the latest trends and tools in deep link testing.
Continuously improve your testing strategies based on feedback and learning.
