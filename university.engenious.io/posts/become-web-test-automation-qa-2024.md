We’ll go over the latest in the web test automation movement, discuss a few of the most important “whys” around jumping into a career in this field, and talk about the top skills you’ll need to break in.

We’ll also compare a couple of the top tools in web test automation, go through the steps you need to take to get your foot in the door and provide some top-level info on courses you can take here at Engenious University (EU) to help you get going fast.

So, let’s get going with a bit of background…  

## The Emergence of Web Test Automation
The digital world is expanding faster than ever, and with that growth comes the need for more efficient, reliable testing methods. 

Enter web test automation.

This testing methodology is all about using tools and scripts to perform repetitive testing tasks to make sure web applications work correctly across different browsers and devices. 

## Why Web Test Automation?
To understand why test automation has become so critical, imagine the huge number of updates a major ecommerce platform makes on a regular basis. Each update has to be tested across devices and browsers.

Manually, this level of testing would be time-consuming. However, with web test automation, scripts handle repetitive, cross-device, and browser test procedures quickly and accurately.

As a result, the site maintains top performance across the board, and site usability rarely skips a beat.

### Efficiency and Speed
As we explained in the hypothetical scenario above, automated tests run much faster than manual ones. Scripts can execute thousands of complex test cases during every test run, providing a level of coverage that’s impossible with manual testing.

For example, a manual tester might take days to run a full regression test suite. Automation, on the other hand, can complete this same process in hours or, using a tool like Marathon Cloud, as little as 15 minutes.

### Consistency
Automated testing eliminates the risk of human error. Though it performs the same operations as manual test processes, the execution is precise every time, maintaining test quality.

For instance, a human being may have a long day and, as a result, forget to check a central feature. A script will never experience a long day, much less one that makes it tired. This consistency maintains high standards without skipping a beat.

### Cost-Effectiveness
While the initial setup for automation can be expensive, it pays off in the long run by reducing the hours spent on manual testing.

Consider a startup that’s short on funds. Its stakeholders might be anxious about the initial investment in automated tests. However, in the long run as the company scales up, they’ll find they’ve saved thousands in diminished manual testing hours.

### Reusability
Reusability is arguably the greatest advantage of automated test scripts. Once written, they can be used across multiple versions of an application, saving massive amounts of time and effort.

Imagine a test script for a constantly updated function, such as a login. The login’s test script can be reused automatically every time the application is updated.

The script’s reusability saves time and guarantees that the login function is always in working order, regardless of the number of updates.

Now that you’ve got a general idea about the “whys” of web test automation, we can jump into the most important skills you’ll need to succeed in the industry.

## Top Skills Needed for Web Test Automation QA
### Programming Knowledge
A good grasp of programming languages like [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is a given, but understanding the basics is enough. You don’t need to be a coding wizard.

For example, say a bug arises in the test script, you should know how to read and write code so you can quickly fix the bug and keep the testing process running smoothly.

### Familiarity with Automation Tools
Knowing how to use tools like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and Playwright is a must. Each tool has its strengths, and understanding which tool to use in different scenarios will help you out significantly.

For instance, [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is great for broad browser support, while [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) offers top performance for modern web apps. Choosing the right tool can save a lot of time and trouble.

### Understanding of Web Tech
Knowledge of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and JavaScript will help you understand the applications you’re testing and write better automation scripts.

When a test fails, for instance, knowing these technologies helps you pinpoint whether the issue is with the script or the application itself.

### Analytical Skills
Analyzing results and identifying issues is a big part of web test automation. So, strong analytical skills will help you pinpoint where things go wrong and why.

For example, if a test case fails, analyzing logs and outputs can help identify whether the problem is with the application code, test script, or environment.

### Attention to Detail
With meticulous attention to detail, you’ll be able to write scripts that cover all possible scenarios.

Overlooking a small detail, like an element locator, can cause a test to fail. When you’re careful to achieve accuracy, you can prevent these kinds of issues.

You can have all the skills in the world, but they won’t matter much if you don’t have the right web test automation tools. Below is a comparison of some of the best and most widely used tools out there.

To become a successful automation test engineer, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with all of these tools.

## Web Test Automation Tools Comparison
### Selenium
