# From QA to Test Automation Engineer: A Guide to Elevate Your Career

Learn how Igor Dorovskikh, CEO and founder of web and mobile development company Engenious.io, navigated the shift from manual QA tester to test automation engineer without quitting his day job.

Imagine shifting your career from the traditional role of manual QA to the trailblazing sphere of test automation‚Äîwithout having to resign from your QA testing job.

Sounds too good to be true, right?

I‚Äôm here to tell you it‚Äôs not and to show you that my own career path is living proof.

From the bottom floor of manual testing at tech giants like Barnes & Noble, Expedia, and Apple, I‚Äôve navigated my way up to spearheading test automation initiatives as an engineering leader at Tinder. 

Today, I‚Äôm the founder and CEO of my own app development company.

It was hard work but worth it. In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving software development landscape, the role of test automation can‚Äôt be overstated. 

Automation is an absolute hero of efficiency, precision, and unparalleled quality in our development processes.

If my journey has taught me anything, it‚Äôs the invaluable role test automation plays in fostering progress. (Plus, it pays way better and is way more interesting than manual QA.)

If you‚Äôre ready to join up but you‚Äôd rather not upend your life, you‚Äôre in the right place. 

In this post, you‚Äôll get an overview of test automation, and I‚Äôll clue you in on some things to consider when deciding whether to go the Android, iOS, web, or back-end app development route.

Best of all, you‚Äôll get the lowdown on how I transitioned from QA tester to test automation engineer without quitting my day job.

So, let‚Äôs get to it!

# Section 1: Understanding the Foundations
## The Basics
You‚Äôll be pleased to know that the transition to test automation begins with a deep-rooted understanding of manual testing. I know now that my early days in the trenches, learning the ins and outs of software testing cycles, were critical to laying the groundwork for my later success in automation. 

It‚Äôs crucial to grasp the essence of manual testing before adding the complexity of automation into the mix.

For example, for iOS, you need an understanding of Swift (or something similar) and the Xcode development environment. This knowledge will be crucial when the time comes to learn [how to work with XCUITest](https://university.engenious.io/courses/7) (and that time will come).

All this is to say, be patient and don‚Äôt lose heart. 

All the basic stuff you‚Äôre learning now is part of the process. Put your heart into manual testing now, and you‚Äôll be a better test automation engineer later.

## Resolving the ‚ÄúChicken or the Egg‚Äù Dilemma

The ‚Äúchicken or egg‚Äù dilemma is a common starting point in the test-automation journey: Should you first dive into programming or start with learning automation tools? 

I‚Äôve come to advocate for a balanced strategy that‚Äôs served me well over the years. 

A solid understanding of programming and the development environment is crucial. For me, mastering languages relevant to my domain and understanding how to leverage development tools were stepping stones to creating efficient automation scripts.

Therefore, it‚Äôs really important to grasp the basics of the programming language most relevant to your domain. If you‚Äôre in the iOS realm, [Swift is an excellent starting point for beginners](https://university.engenious.io/courses/7).

Understanding the development environment and getting a feel for basic app development will lay the groundwork for what comes next.

## Choosing Your Domain

Specialization is king. Whether web, iOS, Android, or back-end, picking a domain and becoming proficient in it is essential. Your specialization will make you a valuable asset and will open doors to tailored opportunities in test automation. There are a couple of important factors to consider when deciding which route to take, one of which is pay.

As you can see below, the pay differential (listed highest to lowest) is significant. According to [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/), the average back-end developer pulls in more than twice as much as the standard web developer:

[back-end] (https://www.indeed.com/career/back-end-developer/salaries?from=top_sb) ‚Äì $157,188

[Android](https://www.indeed.com/career/android-developer/salaries) ‚Äì $128,802

[iOS](https://www.indeed.com/career/ios-developer/salaries?from=top_sb) ‚Äì $125,661

[Web](https://www.indeed.com/career/web-developer/salaries?from=top_sb) ‚Äì $79,788

However, Mom was right: There‚Äôs more to life than money.

When making your decision, ask yourself what you enjoy doing most. After all, this may be your job for the rest of your life. 

And a few hundred thousand dollars aren‚Äôt worth it if you‚Äôre miserable.

üëâ IMPORTANT POINT
Regardless of your preferred platform, if you‚Äôve got a manual QA job, stay where you‚Äôre at. If Android would make more sense than back-end automation at your job, go with Android. 
You‚Äôll get a foundation in automation, and you can always learn your preferred platform later on.

## Building a Portfolio
Showcasing your skills through a [test automation engineering portfolio](https://youtu.be/mS8nfLzySzU?si=5IJnMu7wGKpCFCvC) is your ticket to demonstrating your worth.

For my portfolio, I picked projects highlighting my ability to use automation to streamline testing processes and improve efficiencies. What you include will depend on your industry and interests.

Mobile is currently the trendiest industry. Since the world is focused on mobile, consider incorporating at least one mobile test automation project.

PRO TIP: Include more than just a basic sign-in process in your portfolio. Instead, display complete examples of how your code works across different pages.

Whatever your specialization, your portfolio should reflect two things:

Your technical capabilities
Your ability to solve testing challenges using innovative solutions

# Section 2: Finding Your Opportunity
Learning by Doing
To echo Aristotle, ‚ÄúFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.‚Äù

It‚Äôs ironic but true. To start with test automation, you have to dive in and start doing it.

My first foray was at Barnes & Noble when I had the opportunity to automate the web reader using Java, TestNG, and WebDriver.

That‚Äôs precisely the type of hands-on, real-world application experience you need to learn the ropes. You can also find opportunities at your current job as a manual QA. Just give it some thought, and keep reading.

## Choosing a Real Project

Identifying the right project to apply your automation skills is key. Ideally, you want to find opportunities that:

Challenge you
Have a tangible impact on your team‚Äôs efficiency
Look for the pain points in your current processes and try to address them through automation. 

For example, what‚Äôs that super slow manual process everyone complains about? Is the process automatable? If so, set to work figuring out how to make it faster with automation.

The great news is that you‚Äôre not alone. There are tons of online resources available to help you figure things out.

You can start with [Engenious University‚Äôs collection of free materials](https://university.engenious.io/). We‚Äôve got:

[Blog posts](https://university.engenious.io/posts?page=1&per_page=10)
[Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Engenious)

[Courses](https://university.engenious.io/courses/all-courses)
You can even do a free [30-minute consult session](https://university.engenious.io/mentorship) with one of our industry-leading engineers.

## What if You Don‚Äôt Have Access to Automation Opportunities?
You might work at a non-tech job, have a QA job without automation opportunities, or be unemployed. 

In those cases, you‚Äôll have to find your own automation opportunities. But don‚Äôt worry!

There are endless open-source projects out there. All you have to do is find the right one and get involved. To find an [open-source initiative](https://testsigma.com/open-source-contribution-for-testers) that fits your plan, just do a quick Google search.

# Section 3: Take the Deep Dive
## How I Dove In
At some point, you‚Äôve got to go for it and start automating. You‚Äôll make mistakes and might even break something and have to fix it. But failure is part of the process, so expect, embrace, and learn from it.

Following is the balanced learning path I took, step by step. It‚Äôs also what I recommend to anyone standing at the crossroads, wondering whether to tackle programming languages or automation tools first.

Building a simple app helps you grasp the fundamentals of the development process, making it easier to understand where and how you can apply test automation effectively.
It lays a practical foundation for learning how to automate tests by giving you a firsthand look at the application flow, behavior under different conditions, and points of potential failure, all of which are critical for crafting meaningful automated tests.
Initiating automation with basic tests is an excellent early step in learning test automation. It allows you to gradually familiarize yourself with test automation frameworks and tools without becoming overwhelmed.
This approach helps build confidence and competence by tackling manageable tasks, laying a solid foundation for understanding more complex testing scenarios and automation concepts.
Over time, as my understanding deepened, I refined these tests and ventured into more advanced concepts like [CI/CD integration](https://engenious.io/posts/what-is-ci-cd-and-how-does-it-work), [network mocking](https://help.testim.io/docs/mock-network-responses), and [parallel test execution](https://engenious.io/posts/ios-xcuitest-parallelization).
Mastering [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [CI/CD Tools](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-tools)‚ÄîProficiency with these tools is non-negotiable. Automation tests inevitably become a part of the development process, requiring familiarity with [version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control#:~:text=Version%20control%2C%20also%20known%20as,to%20source%20code%20over%20time.) and [continuous integration tools like Jenkins](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Jenkins#:~:text=Jenkins%20is%20an%20open%20source,%2FCD%20workflows%2C%20called%20pipelines.).
Then, I progressed to using [XCUITest for automation](https://university.engenious.io/courses/7). With this iOS-tailored tool, I could apply my understanding of the [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and app development to create efficient and effective automated tests.

This phased approach made the transition to test automation smoother and ensured that I built a solid foundation in programming alongside my automation skills.

## Test Automation Frameworks and Tools
It‚Äôs essential to familiarize yourself with the most commonly used test automation tools and frameworks. 

Learning to navigate through tools like [WebDriver](https://www.leapwork.com/blog/what-is-webdriver-in-selenium) and frameworks like [TestNG](https://www.thetesttribe.com/blog/testng-introduction/) was pivotal during my transition. Each tool and framework has unique advantages and uses cases, and understanding which to apply and when is key to effective automation.

The list of commonly used automation platforms and tools below will get you started, but this is one of those things where you can never stop learning:
