Swift basics of Object-Oriented programming, so later you may focus on tasks rather than programming basics
Setup test project from scratch in XCode
Integrate Accessibility Identifiers in-app code for testability
Improve test stability by cleaning up application data via AppDelegate
As we progress, we will refactor tests with industry best practices to make tests more resilient using Page Objects pattern by using Protocols, Extensions, Delegates, ENums and Generic
Intro to RestApi
Make tests more stable with the mock server (every company wants this skill nowadays)
Automating App Analytics ( number one desired test coverage by company’s executives
Decorate tests with advanced features of XCUITest Library such as Async Wait, First Match API, Activities, Attachments, and Screenshot

Lecture 1.1 
Title: 1.1 Welcome
Text: Welcome to the iOS Test Automation with XCUITest course. My name is Igor, a software engineer and solution architect with more than a decade of experience in quality solutions at large enterprises as well as innovative start-ups. This comprehensive course is designed for testers who would like to make a shift in their careers by learning how to automate iOS apps using XCUITest library. This is not a typical course. You will be exposed to real-deal test automation challenges on a startup-like iOS app. We will cover everything from Swift basics to scalable test architecture along with advanced topics such as network mocking, which should pave you a road for a successful career as an iOS SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test ).  Although I will be the main narrator throughout the course, I would like to give full credit for helping to build this content to my best friend and a great iOS Developer -- Boris.

Duration: 00:01:06
Lecture 1.2
Title: 1.2 Code files
Text: In this course, while solving various test automation challenges for iOS native app, we will write and analyze a lot of test code in Swift.  Therefore, you can follow along with the attached playground file for each video in the 2nd module and Xcode project files for other module videos respectively. Please be aware that for XCUITest modules, we will run code in the particular iPhone simulator. Using different versions of the simulator might break existing tests and might require some tweaks in the test code.  If you would like to run tests on the real iPhone, we will show the set up in the later module.

Lecture 1.3
Title: 1.3 What you should know
Text: This is iOS Native test automation course designed to teach you how to solve real-world automation challenges using the XCUITest library which is part of the XCode. During the course of our lectures, we will assume you have some previous exposure to the web or mobile automation frameworks such as WebDriver or Appium. Although this course will be taught in Swift, previous experience with other programming languages would be very beneficial. If you never used the Swift programming language prior to this course, do not worry. We will cover everything you would need to know in the 2nd module and would reiterate on some more advanced topics throughout the course.
